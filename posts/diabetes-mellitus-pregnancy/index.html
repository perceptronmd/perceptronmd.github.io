<p>DM risk increases in preg because of decreased insulin resistance</p>
<p>screen at 24-28 wks</p>
<p>Note: the insulin need NORMALLY increases further in pregnancy;</p>
<p>if pt has decreased need for insulin, worry about growth restriction</p>

<ul>
<li>glucose test

<li>1 -hour test: 50g load</li>
<li>2-hour test: only do this postpartum</li>
<li>3-hour: do if they fail the 1-hr; 100g load; need 2 values abnormal</li>

<h3 id="who-should-be-screened-early">Who should be screened early?</h3>

<li>previous pregnancy complicated by GDM</li>
<li>known glucose intolerance</li>
<li>obesity <a href="https://theplaidjournal.com/index.php/CoM/article/view/44/28">[link]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;One study performed in India recommended early universal screening at the first prenatal visit for all women due to the 11-fold increased risk of developing GDM when compared with Caucasian women. This study also showed increased association of GDM with increasing age, parity, family predisposition, and infertility [8]. Additionally, women who are diagnosed with GDM should be screened 6-12 weeks postpartum with the 75g oral glucose tolerance test due to the increased rate of progression to type 2 diabetes in these women [2].</p>

The patient starts a diet and exercise program and monitors her blood sugars, fasting and 2 hours postprandial. However, as her pregnancy progresses, she finds that it is more challenging to maintain normal blood sugars despite diet and exercise.

<ol>
<li>screen for overt diabetes: check glucose concentrations for 24 to 72 hours after delivery to exclude ongoing hyperglycemia</li>
<li>screen for depression: PPD more common in patients with diabetes vs others</li>
<li>breastfeeding: improves maternal glucose metabolism and thus may reduce the glucose levels obtained during a postpartum glucose tolerance test (GTT). Several prospective studies have reported that <a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetric-issues-and-management/abstract/83-86">breastfeeding decreased the long-term incidence of type 2 diabetes after a diagnosis of GDM compared with not breastfeeding</a>.</li>

<pre><code>- c section
- shoulder dystocia
- polyhydramnios - increased chance preterm lablor, PROM, **obstructed bowel**
    - poly leads to breech presentation (because theres more space in uterus)
    - umbilical cord prolapse - can happen in poly because of unengaged head
    - when uterus deflates suddenly (decrease in size) - placental will separate (palcenta won't just shrink with the uterus)
- placenta will NOT increase with size of baby; baby is fixed as to how much oxygen it can extract; sugars will make baby acidotic =&gt; tissue damage (birth abnormalities if before 12 wks)
    - if insult baby BEFORE 12 wks
        - insult can be anything: infexn, high sugar, chemicals
        - abnormal baby =&gt; **birth defects**
    - if you insult the baby AFTER 12 wks = **growth abnormalities**, fetal death
    - hint: if you give sugar water w/o oxygen -- you start fermenting, make alcohol

- abnormalities: skeletal, CNS, heart
    - sacaral agenesis
    - caudal regression syndrome
    - spina bifida
    - andecelpha
    - transposition of great arteries
- HbA1c vs birth abnormalities
    - &lt;6.5: same risk as any othe rperson
    - &gt;10: cutoff for HIGH risk (20%) of birth abnormality
</code></pre>
<h2 id="other-notes">Other notes</h2>
<p>White classification</p>
<pre><code>* A1 GDM: requires insulin
* A2 GDM: does NOT require insulin
</code></pre>
<p>other things to check in GDM</p>
<pre><code>- HAVE: risk of preE - check CMP
- DO NOT have: ketoacidois, diabetic retinopathy, kidney disease (dont have enough time to cause that damage)
</code></pre>
<p>when pts have kidney disease, are smoker, etc =&gt; placental insufficiency</p>
<pre><code>- if pt is smoker AND has GDM =&gt; causes premature lungs in baby
- lungs dont mature well - baby can be full term and still have respiratory distres syndrome
</code></pre>
