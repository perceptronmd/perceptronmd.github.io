			<p>Age: 70<br>
Gender: F<br>
Diagnosis: 6cm R thyroid nodule</p>
<p>Patient is a 70 year old woman who was referred to our clinic from an outside provider. She has a history of enlarged thyroid, more prominently on the right side, and has had multiple benign biopsies in the past. A nodule on the right side showed growth from 4.3 cm to 6 cm this year causing her to experience occasional cough and pressure in the neck. She denies changes in voice, history of ionizing radiation to the head and neck, and family history of thyroid cancer.</p>
<p>Patient’s R thyroid nodule was benign (colloid and benign follicular cells present, consistent with a colloid nodule) however there were multiple mildly suspicious nodules near the isthmus. Surgery was indicated given the patient&rsquo;s clinical symptoms.</p>
<p>Total thyroidectomy was performed. The recurrent laryngeal nerve was preserved bilaterally. The R thyroid nodule was extracted and sent to the inpatient pathology lab. The patient did not have post-operative complcations in the PACU. Around 12% of thyroidectomy patients develop PTH deficiency after surgery.(Youngwirth et al. 2010). Patient&rsquo;s post-operative PTH was normal and the patient was discharged on the same day.</p>
