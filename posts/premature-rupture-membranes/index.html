clinic for a new patient visit. Her history is significant vaginal delivery 12
months ago. Beginning at 24 weeks in her previous pregnancy, the patient
presented numerous times to Labor and Delivery reporting contractions, and
she was sent home each time with a diagnosis of “Braxton-Hicks contractions.”
She eventually presented at 28-weeks gestation and was diagnosed with preterm
labor. She delivered at 29 weeks. The neonate’s course was complicated by
intra-ventricular hemorrhage and respiratory distress syndrome. The child
now appears to have cerebral palsy and chronic lung disease due to
bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

<ul>
<li>#1 risk factor = previous preterm pregnancy; patient has this</li>
<li>polyhydramnios</li>
<li>short cervical length; LEEP or Cone bx from abnormal pap smear</li>
<li>placental abruption (from 2nd trimester bleeding); note: smoking disrupts the intima in vessels</li>
<li>infection (chorioamnionitis)</li>
<li>had amniocentesis</li>
<li><strong>genital tract infection</strong></li>
<li>connective tissue disorders (Ehlers Danlos)</li>
<li>short inter-pregnancy interval (&lt;6-18 mos)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-what-characteristics-distinguish-braxton-hicks-contractions-from-true-labor-contractions">2. What characteristics distinguish Braxton-Hicks contractions from true labor contractions?</h2>
<ul>
<li>labor contractions: 45+ seconds; every 2-3 mins</li>
<li>Braxton hicks; CTX do NOT have increasing intensity and increasing frequency</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Note: obstetric visit history questions: 1. fetal movement, 2. contractions, 3. leakage of fluid, 4. bleeding</li>

What recommendations, if any, would you discuss with this patient regarding prevention strategies to reduce the risk of preterm delivery in this pregnancy? To reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and other morbidity associated with preterm labor in this fetus should she experience preterm labor?</h2>
<ul>
<li>reduce the risk of preterm delivery: tocolytics</li>
<li>antenatal corticosteroids: betamethasone, dexamethasone: promotes fetal lung maturity in the absence of intra-amniotic infection before 32-36 wks GA</li>
<li>folic acid (1st trimester)</li>
</ul>

If the patient does experience PTL in this pregnancy, what recommendations would you make regarding treatment and management? When would you consider tocolysis (i.e. giving medications in an attempt to stop contractions)?</h2>
<p>progesterone</p>
<p>tocolysis: indomethacin, nifedipine/terbutaline (CCB), mag sulfate; stop this after 48 hrs; do not give at all, after 34 wks &ndash; at this point, the risk of preterm labor regarding the fetus are at lowest level at 34 wks, so don&rsquo;t give tocolytics after 34 wks</p>
<p>if term: first check GBS status and fetal presentation; then labor may be induced, or pt can be observed for 6 hours</p>
<p>if 34-36 GA: labor induction may be considered</p>
<p>if &lt;32 weeks GA: expectant management with bed rest and pelvic rest</p>
<p>if signs of infection or fetal distress, give ABX (ampicillin/penicillin/gentamicin) and induce Labor</p>
<p>GBS prophylaxis: penicillin</p>
<h2 id="6-what-are-potential-adverse-outcomes-of-preterm-birth-for-the-fetus">6. What are potential adverse outcomes of preterm birth for the fetus?</h2>
<ul>
<li>risk to baby (for delivering preterm)
<ul>
<li>Brain: <strong>intraventricular hemorrhage</strong> (b/c blood vessels are not supported well) =&gt; seizure</li>
<li>Bowel: necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis
<ul>
<li>baby doesn;t have as good resistance to infxn, so bugs enter bowel</li>

<li>Lung: resp distress =&gt; bronchopulmonary dysplasia</li>
