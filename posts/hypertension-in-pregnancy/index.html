visit. She has had an uncomplicated pregnancy up to this point, with the
exception of a late onset of prenatal care and obesity (BMI of 35 kg/m2).
She reports that during the past week, she has noted some swelling of her
hands and feet. She also has been feeling a bit more fatigued and has had a
headache on and off. She reports good fetal movement.

She has had some contractions on and off, but nothing persistent. Her blood
pressure is 147/92 and her urine dip has 1+ protein/no ketones/no glucose.
The fundal height measures 36 cm, the fetus is cephalic with a heart rate
of 144 bpm. On physical exam you note that the patient has 3+ pre-tibial
edema, and trace edema of her hands and face. She has 2+ deep tendon
reflexes and 2 beats of clonus. You review her blood pressures up to this
point and note that at the time of her first prenatal visit at 18 weeks,
her blood pressure was 130/76 and she had no protein in her urine. However,
since that visit, her blood pressures seem to have been climbing higher
with each visit. Her last visit was one week ago, and she had a blood
pressure of 138/88 with trace protein in the urine and she has
gained 5 pounds.

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="10-when-is-delivery-usually-recommended">10. When is delivery usually recommended?</h2>
<p>Normally: 37 weeks - induction;</p>
<p>severe preE before 34 wks</p>
<pre><code>- Prevent eclampsia (MgSO4) - seizure prophylaxis
- Control maternal BP (hydralazine, labetalol)
- Deliver fetus (betamethasone)
- methyldopa
- check the baby- HTN can cause FGR from placental insufficeincy
</code></pre>
<p>if preE, low platelets, need C section, use GENERAL anesthesia and give plts</p>
<pre><code>- do not give spinal anesthesia because even minor bleeding can paralyze the pt
</code></pre>
<p>if mild preE at 34 wks:</p>
<pre><code>- defeintely deliver them at 37 wks
- see them 1-2x weekly (monitor more frequently: BPP, NST)
- check labs more frequently

<p>Future risk of preeclampsia</p>
<h2 id="other">other</h2>
<p>if pt starts bleeding, uterine pain, and has pre-E</p>
<pre><code>- c/o abruption
- need to do VAGINAL delivery (risk of bleeding is more with C section)
- uterus stop bleeding by increasing tone =&gt; blood vessels get closed (when it contracts, the muscle fibers are &quot;clamping the blood vessels&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>when patients have twins - higher risk of preE because MORE PLACENTAL tissue</li>
</ul>
