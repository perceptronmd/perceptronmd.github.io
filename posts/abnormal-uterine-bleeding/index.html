menstrual bleeding. Prior to 6 months ago her cycles occurred every 28-30 days,
lasted for 6 days, and were associated with cramps that were relieved
by Ibuprofen. In the last 6 months there has been a change with menses
occurring every 25-32 days, lasting 7-10 days and associated with cramps not
relieved by ibuprofen, passing clots and using two boxes of maxi pads each
cycle. She is worried about losing her job if the bleeding is not better
controlled. She denies dizziness, but complains of feeling weak
and fatigued. Her weight has not changed in the last year. She denies any
bleeding disorders or reproductive cancers in the family. She uses condoms
for contraception. She takes no daily medications and has no other medical problems.
She is married and works in a factory.

On physical exam, her weight is 150 pounds, height is 5 feet, 6 inches,
BP 130/88, P 100. She appears pale. Pelvic exam shows normal vulva,
vagina and cervix; normal sized, non-tender, mobile uterus; non-tender
adnexae without palpable masses.
</code></pre></div><h2 id="1-what-are-the-parameters-of-a-normal-menstrual-cycle">1. What are the parameters of a normal menstrual cycle?</h2>
<pre><code>- 21 to 35 days, first to first
- &lt;2 days flow=  oligomenorreha; 7+ days = menometrorrhagia
- Example
  - If 35 day cycle, ovulation happen at 35-14=21 day
    - Once ovulation happen there are two type of cysts:
      - Follicular cyst: has an egg, produces estrogen ONLY
      - Corpus luteum cyst: produces estrogen AND progesterone
        - Estrogen only = follicular phase
        - Estrogen and prog together = secretory phase
    - 14 day impt because corpus luteum can live 14 days

<li>Ovulatory dysfunction; will not see bigger uterus</li>
<li>Management = OCPs; can encourage weight loss but that takes longer time</li>

<pre><code>    - vWF
    - F8 deficiency (hemophilia A)
    - Platelet deficiency
    - Fibrinogen deficiency
    - acquired
      - Heparin induced
      - Liver disease
      - Taking blood thinners
      - Infection of uterus
      - Immune mediated - ITP, SLE, RA
      - Cancer - leukemia, lymphoma etc (WBC 40K)
</code></pre>
<p>General rule:</p>
<pre><code>    - if pt &lt;35-40 yo, never do a bx first, look for other systemic causes (1. PCOS, 2. Genetic or acquired coagulopathy)
    - If pt 40+
      - No atrophy unless pt in menopause (no cycles for 12 months)
      - Over 40 that is normal but can cause abnl bleeding
        - Perimenopause:
          - Decline of ovulatory function; it becomes estrogen dependent;
            - Normally progesterone cleans that up, but with unopposed estrogen there is more growth of uterine lining (like a lawn that grows but you dont have a lawnmower (progesterone))
          - Tx:
            - LNG IUD, cyclic progesterone, OCP
            - Surgery
              - Hysterectomy,
              - endometrial ablation,
              - myometomy,
              - embolization (IR does this)
