The patient does not take hormone replacement therapy. The patient underwent image-guided segmental mastectomy. The patient did not experience complications in the PACU after the operation and was discharged on the same day." />

Gender: F<br>
Diagnosis: ductal carcinoma in situ, ER+/PR+/HER2-</p>
<p>Patient is a 62 year old female that presented with a 2.4cm mass that was identified on routine mammography. Biopsy of the mass identified it as ductal carcinoma in situ (TisN0M0, ER+/PR+/HER2-). The patient does not have a history of breast or ovarian cancer. The patient does not take hormone replacement therapy. The patient underwent image-guided segmental mastectomy. The patient did not experience complications in the PACU after the operation and was discharged on the same day. The patient will follow up in clinic about next steps for treatment which may include radiation and/or hormone therapy.</p>
<p>The NCCN guidelines for primary treatment for this patient include lumpectomy with whole breast radiation therapy, total mastectomy with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy, or lumpectomy alone, with most patients choosing breast conserving therapy. For risk reduction following the initial breast conserving therapy, treatment with radiation therapy and/or endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor) for 5 years.</p>
<p>OncoTypeDX is a validated and widely used prognostic tool for recurrence, which is used for guiding the decision in whether a patient should get chemotherapy. It should be noted that OncoTypeDX has tests for both early stage invasive cancer as well as ductal carcinoma in situ. Two trials were conducted for validation for the DCIS score. The first study, ECOG E5194(Solin et al. 2015), found that using the DCIS score result along with tumor type and age, is able to identify patients with low risk of local recurrence compared to using DCIS score alone (25.9% vs 17.7% identified); it is also able to identify patients with high risk of local occurrence compared to DCIS score alone (21.1% vs 18.4%). The second study showed that DCIS score is effective in predicting local recurrence either with or without clear margins. (Rakovitch et al. 2015)</p>
<p>Regarding early stage invasive tumors, the most recent trial, the TAILORx trial, calibrated a cutoff score of 25 (out of 100) to determine “high” chance of recurrence, thus indicating that any patient with a score &gt;25 should get chemotherapy. Furthermore, while a score of 11-25 would not indicate a need for chemotherapy, there is evidence that chemotherapy could be of benefit to individuals over the age 50.</p>
