Diagnosis: R breast invasive ductal carcinoma cT1N0Mx, ER+, PR+, HER2-</p>
<p>Patient is a 70 year old woman with R breast mass discovered on routine mammography. Core biopsy confirmed it was R breast invasive ductal carcinoma cT1N0Mx, ER+, PR+, HER2-. She is not on adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient denies a history of ovarian cancer or breast cancer, and denies family history of ovarian or breast cancer. The patient denies having had genetic testing. On exam, there are no palpable masses and no palpable lymph nodes.</p>
<p>The patient was recommended to get a lumpectomy as well as sentinel lymph node biopsy (for staging). Of note, the patient and her caregiver collectively refused to get the lymph node biopsy due to a desire to limit surgical intervention given the patient’s comorbidities.</p>
<p>We performed a lumpectomy with needle localization. The patient did not have post-operative complications in the PACU. We plan to discharge the patient on the same day.</p>
<p>Of note, the patient refused lymph node biopsy. However, typically for staging the sentinel lymph node biopsy would be required. The clinical staging was T1N0Mx, but we would not have known nodal status without the biopsy. A relevant trial is ACOSOG Z11, which (Giuliano et al. 2017)
Diagnostic and prognostic tools should take large role in management of patient. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be used as potential biomarker for prognostic purposes although more work is required on validation of the methods in prospective trials. In TNBC, a recent study showed a statistically significant relationship between identification of ctDNA at completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and relapse-free survival as well as overall survival.  (Cavallone et al. 2020)</p>
