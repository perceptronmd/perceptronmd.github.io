of severe lower abdominal pain. Pain is constant, bilateral and accompanied
by fever and chills. She has had some nausea and several episodes of vomiting.
She has been sexually active for 3 years and has had unprotected intercourse
with several partners. She denies irregular bleeding, dysmenorrhea or
dyspareunia. Past medical history is non contributory. Past surgical history
is remarkable for tonsillectomy as a child and an uncomplicated vaginal
delivery one year ago.

Physical exam reveals an ill appearing 16-year-old with a temperature of
98.6° F (37° Celsius) and has a pulse of 94 bpm, BP 124/82 and a respiratory
rate 22 breaths/minute. On examination of the abdomen, bowel sounds are
present, there is bilateral lower abdominal tenderness and the abdomen is
slightly distended with rebound, negative psoas and Murphy’s signs. Pelvic
exam reveals the BUS (Bartholins, Urethral, Skene’s glands) to be normal and
the vagina to be pink and moist. There is a purulent discharge from the
cervical os and the cervix appears indurated. The uterus is in the midline
position and is soft and tender to palpation. There is bilateral adnexal
fullness and moderate tenderness.

Laboratory evaluation includes positive GC, negative RPR and WBC 17.6 with a
left shift. Urinalysis is remarkable for few WBC’s, no bacteria, no leukocyte
esterase, no nitrites, 3+ ketones and negative urine HCG.

<h2 id="other-scenarios">other scenarios</h2>
<h3 id="1-pt-with-pid-is-hds-has-fever">1. Pt with PID, is HDS, has fever</h3>
<pre><code>* Tx: Ceftriaxone (give IM), doxycycline (PO)
  * If pt is vomiting a lot, may not be able to take doxy PO =&gt; give azithromycin
  * NOTE: azithro does not tx PID, its only for cervicitis (G/C)
  * If pt has high fever, tachy, very toxic =&gt; Keep pt in hospital
  * If pt has adnexal mass on US showing tubo-ovarian abscess =&gt; Keep pt in hospital
  * TREAT the partner, and follow pt in the office; **“PID is always a 2 people disease, not one”**
  * Screen for other STDs
  * Follow up in 3-4 for test of cure (TOC)
  * Counseling
    - Every incidence of PID raises ectopic pregnancy risk by 12%
    - If pt is pregnant, present to the office as soon as they know they are pregnant (b/c ectopic can happen within 6 weeks of pregnancy, although pt may not know they are pregnant until 4 weeks into pregnancy)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="2-hsv-herpes">2. HSV (Herpes):</h3>
<pre><code>* Primary:
    - painful lesions on vulva with urinary retention;
    - systemic sx
    - bilateral
* Secondary:
    - 3-4 lesions on one side of vulva (likely secondary, even if pt doesnt have history of herpes)
    - Tx:
      - Acyclovir, valacyclovir
      - Chronic suppressive tx
</code></pre>
<h3 id="3-hpv-genital-warts">3. HPV (genital warts)</h3>
<pre><code>* Tx
    - Excision, cauterization, excision
    - Imiquimod (immunomodulator)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="4-hiv">4. HIV</h3>
<h3 id="5-syphillis">5. Syphillis</h3>
<pre><code>* Say pt is RPR/VDRL is positive
  - Need to confirm with specific treponemal test (antibody test)
    - Note: pregnancy itself can increase chance of false positive RPR/VDRL
* Tx
  - Penicillin

</code></pre>
<h3 id="7-gonorrheal-vs-chlamydial-pid">7. Gonorrheal vs Chlamydial PID</h3>
<pre><code>* Gonorrhea: More febrile, more likely to have infections in other areas, more purulence
  - Easy to treat
* Chlamydia: more silent, subacute, likely to be missed
  - Can persist in spite of treatment
