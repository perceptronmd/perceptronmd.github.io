<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">A 36-year-old G1P0010 woman presents to the office with onset of light vaginal
bleeding, which she feels is not her menstrual period, and mild right lower
quadrant pain, which she rates as 2/10. The pain is intermittent and
crampy, and is not associated with urination. There is no nausea or vomiting.
The patient’s last bowel movement was yesterday and was normal in consistency
without blood or black color. Her past medical history is notable for no
allergies, no medications, and two hospitalizations. The first was eight years
ago for lower abdominal pain which was thought to be due to pelvic inflammatory
disease and which resolved with antibiotics. The second was for a left
ectopic pregnancy that required surgical removal of her left tube.
Review of systems and family history are unremarkable. Social history reveals
that she is mutually monogamous with a male partner without contraception.

Physical examination shows an anxious appearing female with a temperature of 99.2 ° F, orally, a BP of 105/62, and a pulse of 95. Examination of her abdomen reveals normal bowel sounds.
There are no masses, organomegaly, distention, or rebound tenderness.
She has mild discomfort in the right lower quadrant. Pelvic examination
reveals right adnexal tenderness without adnexal masses. Uterus is of
normal size and there is discomfort on cervical motion. The rectal exam is
negative with heme negative stool.

What is the differential diagnosis for this patient? What aspects of her history and physical examination might lead you to be suspicious of an ectopic pregnancy? (*indicates signs or symptoms for teaching case)</h2>
<ul>
<li>PID, ectopic pregnancy, early pregnancy loss (spotaneous/threatened abortion), cervical/vaginal/uterine pathology (polyps, fibroids, adenomyosis, cancer), GTD</li>
<li>Non-gyn: UTI/pyelo, kidney stone/hydro (b/c ureter can wrap around the flank; stone comes intermittently), cystitis (burning urination, frequency, urgency, cloudy urine, bloody urine)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anatomy (A to P) vs dx</p>
<pre><code>* Bladder
* Ureter (bilat)
* Uterus
* Vagina
* Cervix
  * PID sx (purulent d/c at cervix, pain, fever, bilat lower abd pain; usu PID and preg don’t happen together)
    * Cervicitis (will have PID sx)
* Ovary
  * Ruptured cyst (unilat pain, cervical motion tenderness, no purulent d/c)
  * Ovarian torsion (Sudden onset, N/V/maybe elevated WBC, preg test negative, having a period)
  * Endometriosis

* Fallopian tube
* Bowel
  * Sigmoiditis, gastroenteritis, rectal inflammation etc
    * Diarrhea, abd pain
  * 2-3 wks diarrhea, elevated WBC, N, stool out the vagina
    * Crohns, UC; note: usually if it just happened once its probably gastroenteritis (it resolves in a week; if recurrent =&gt; IBD)
</code></pre>
<p>Sx to dx</p>
<ul>
<li>R sided pain, worse first in the AM, worse with mvmt, no pelvic tenderness, no elevated WBC, pelvic exam negative
<ul>
<li>spondyloarthropathy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>45 yo F, Pain last month, can’t go upstairs, muscles in R thigh atrophic, sensation decreased in R thigh
<ul>
<li>Lower motor neuron issue: either nerve level or spine; could be a growth thats compressing the sciatic/femoral * nerve, or in the spine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pt had tubes tied 10 yrs ago / or had tubal surgery for other reason, but preg test positive
<ul>
<li>Need to rule out ectopic</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-what-are-the-risk-factors-for-ectopic-pregnancy-and-which-of-these-risk-factors-does-the-patient-have--indicates-patient-risk-factors-for-teaching-case">2. What are the risk factors for ectopic pregnancy and which of these risk factors does the patient have (* indicates patient risk factors for teaching case)?</h2>
<p>high risk: <em>previous ectopic pregnancy</em>, previous tubal surgery, tubal pathology, sterilization, IUD use (past and current), IVF in current preg;</p>
<p>moderate risk: *previous PID, smoking, previous STI, previous OCP use, previous pelvic/abd surgery, previous spont abort</p>
<h2 id="3-where-can-ectopic-pregnancies-occur-and-how-frequently-does-this-happen">3. Where can ectopic pregnancies occur and how frequently does this happen?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fallopian tube (96% of ectopics)</li>
<li>Ovarian (1-3% of all ectopics)</li>
<li>Interstitial (1-3% of all ectopics)</li>
<li>Other: Cervical, abdominal, and cesarean scar pregnancies are rare</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-what-initial-test-would-you-order-for-this-patient-to-assist-you-in-narrowing-down-your-diagnosis">4. What initial test would you order for this patient to assist you in narrowing down your diagnosis?</h2>
<p><strong>bHCG</strong>: For TVUS, we use a bHCG discriminatory zone of 3510 milli-international units/mL
The discriminatory zone is the serum hCG level above which a gestational sac should be visualized when an IUP is present.</p>
<h2 id="5-if-this-patients-test-is-positive-what-tests-could-be-helpful-in-making-a-more-definitive-diagnosis">5. If this patient’s test is positive, what tests could be helpful in making a more definitive diagnosis?</h2>
<pre><code>* Ultrasound (Transvaginal): gestational sac with a yolk sac or embryo (with or without a heartbeat) outside the uterus
* Other labs

  - Serum progesterone – Serum progesterone concentrations are higher in viable IUPs than in ectopic pregnancies and IUPs that are destined to abort
  - Uterine aspiration – The intrauterine location of a pregnancy is diagnosed with certainty if trophoblastic tissue is obtained by uterine curettage
</code></pre>
<h2 id="6-what-options-are-available-for-the-management-of-ectopic-pregnancy">6. What options are available for the management of ectopic pregnancy?</h2>
<pre><code>* MTX
* Salpingectomy
* Salpingostomy
</code></pre>
<h2 id="other-scenarios-discussed">Other scenarios discussed</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tachy 150s, 80/40, acute abdomen, diffuse tenderness, distended</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably ruptured ectopic =&gt; to OR immediately</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tachy, BP normal, abd tenderness, rebound guarding, +preg test positive, quant bHCG 1000, US shows no preg (note: b/c BP normal you do all the tests)</p>
<ul>
<li>To OR immediately (because acute abd)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quant 3500, can see adnexal mass, but pt not tender, no rebound, +pain, can see pregnancy is not in uterus</p>
<ul>
<li>Methotrexate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like above but quant &lt;3500 and US does not show where the preg is</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow up in 2-3 days and repeat US/quants; do not give MTX/surgery</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cervical os is open, you see fetal parts/tissue</p>
<ul>
<li>Spontaneous abortion (miscarriage); if os is open, it is NOT an ectopic pregnancy (unless heterotopic pregnancy)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surgery for ectopic</p>
<ul>
<li>Salpingostomy - need to measure the quants b/c it can be persistent</li>
<li>Salpingectomy - don’t need to measure the quants</li>
</ul>
</li>
