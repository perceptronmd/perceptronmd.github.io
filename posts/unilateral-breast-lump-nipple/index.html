Symptoms began 6 months when she suddenly noticed milky, pustular but non-bloody discharge out of her L nipple. Since that episode she has not had any discharge from the nipple however has noticed a lump underneath the nipple about “quarter sized” as well as intermittent swelling. She notes that the pain is the most intense around the same time she has menstrual periods." />
